### Projects

#### Cocktail Personality Test

- I came up with this project one night in a whimsical dream, inspired by a recent computer science assignment. Everyone has different tastes in drinks that they order at the bar, each drink can display certain traits of certain personalities. Often in a business or social setting with alcohol involved, you often need to quickly analyze someone you may be talking to to gauge their interests and personalities. This personality test can help increase good first impressions in the social and business world.
- I used JDoodle, which is a coding platform that allowed me to code using the Python 3 coding language.
- I faced a multitude of challenges, including learning new skills like error checking, testing, and categorizing the code. I learned that it is better to categorize the code so that when it comes to debugging, the code is easier to tweak.
- I utilized the help of my computer science professor, and my friend with a minor in computer science collaborated with me on this project.
- I set out to make a cocktail personality test to help people in business and social settings achieve a good first impression based on the drink. Given the chance, in the future, I would make the test longer and add more cocktails and drinks for maximum accuracy.

- I came up with this Side Hustle Excel Sheet when I created my first business and needed to keep track of the quantity of items that clients would buy the products. Clients began taking out loans to buy a certain quantity of objects, and I started to lose track of how much they owed me. Hence, I created this Excel Sheet to help me determine loan cost, interest cost, and affordability.
- I used Excel and Excel tools to aid me in completing this project.
- I faced challenges using basic Excel functions, like using equations and conditioning cells. I did collaborate and use the expertise of my father to help me complete this project.
- I set out to make a working Excel sheet that fulfills the requirements of a Side Hustle that tracks the amount a client would owe if a loan were needed to be taken out to buy a certain quality of items.
- If I had to make any improvements on the project, I would make it look more aesthetic and pretty.

- I came up with this project when I needed to figure out the grades that I needed to get to get an A in my Research Methods II Class. I am right on the edge of an A and currently have an A-, I wanted to see the minimum I could get on my upcoming assessments in the class and still maintain or hopefully get an A in the class.
- I faced the challenges of inputting the correct formulas for calculating each letter grade, as well as making graphs and calculating points for each item that makes up the final grade.
- I did not use any other resource nor collaborate with anyone else for this specific project.
- I set out to make a Grade Calculator so that I could calculate my final grade in my class. I did achieve this result, and I would not make any improvements if I had a chance to take this further. Perhaps I would make a grade calculator for each of my classes.
